# mixed-messages-Portfolio-Project

First portfolio project on Codecademy.

Aim of this code is to print 2 random messages based on a training plan for running. 
First message is a weekday workout randomly selecting a certain milage, type of run and motivational message.
Second message is a weekend workout with the same principles as the first.

As I'm still only training I am working out a way of keeping things simple with naming functions/arguments so I can easily focus on just the algorithms/linking with functions instead of being caught up too much on different messages as that'll almost always change in different projects. This will help me down the line to be more efficient with my time and thinking.

I have used an algorithm to randomly select a number.

There are 2 functions with objects, each with 3 keys and arrays as values.

The random number is then pushing 1 value from each array into a new array. Each value is included in a sentence within the new array.

I have then used .join with the new arrays to display/console.log() the messages in different ways.

And the final step is calling the messages.
